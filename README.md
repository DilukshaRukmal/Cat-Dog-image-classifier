## About the Model
This Model differentiates whether an image is of a cat or dog using Convolutional Neural Networks.

The data I collected is a subset of the Kaggle dog/cat dataset. In total, there are 10, 000 images, 80% for the training set, and 20% for the test set. In the training set, 4,000 images of dogs, while the test set has 1,000 images of dogs, and the rest are cats.
